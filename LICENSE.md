                                                      Preamble

                          As the programming community expands and changes, pillars of the 
                          community are expected to accept the demands of a small amount of 
                          people. The new demands made by these people are usually in the form of 
                          a Code of Conduct. A Code of Conduct is created with the point of 
                          separating the community and displacing people who have dedicated a 
                          large amount of time in this community.

                          Most licenses created for software are created by companies/entities 
                          who have also created a dangerous code of conduct or have affiliation 
                          with dangerous code of conducts. By contrast, the Vincent General License 
                          and entities who have contributed in creating this license have not worked 
                          on a Code of Conduct or have any affiliation to one.

                          The goal of the Vincent General License is to create a license that grants power, 
                          freedom, and easibility to both the creator and user of a program and to be a 
                          simple, legible license for anybody to use.

                                                      1. Definitions

                          "Dangerous" refers to works that are made with malice, intent to split up a 
                          community, or intent to cause damage to a project or entity.

                          "This License" refers to the Vincent General License

                          "(the) Program" refers to any work that is/can be copyrighted under this license.

                          "Modification" refers to changing of the work that was not originally part of it. 
                          This could be to force the work to behave in a way it wasn't designed too or to 
                          bypass a law/rule.

                          "You or Your" refers to the entity/company reading this License and/or the creator 
                          of a program

                          "Source Code" refers to the full codebase of a program that can be compiled into 
                          said program.

                          "Distribution" refers to distributing a program of which you are the owner of in 
                          compiled form or source code form.

                          "Redistribution" refers to distributing a program of which you are not the owner 
                          of whether it be in compiled form or source code form.

                                                        2. License

                          You may copy and distribute this license in its ORIGINAL state but You may NOT 
                          distribute this license under payment for viewing or usage privileges. Viewing 
                          and copyrighting a program under the Vincent General License is completely free 
                          and is only subject to the terms and conditions stated in the license.

                                                        3. Source Code

                          It is highly recommended that You disclose the source code of the program under 
                          this License. Disclosing your source code allows users of your program to audit 
                          the code and make sure what the user is running is safe. It is not required that 
                          You make your program open source. When a program is released in source code form 
                          a copy of this license must be included.

                                                        4. Distribution

                          You may distribute a program in source code form and compiled form. You may also 
                          distribute the compiled form of your program as paid software. It is not advised 
                          that you disclose your source code if you are putting a program against a paywall.

                                                        5. Redistribution

                          Whether you choose to redistribute a program licensed under this license on a chat 
                          platform or your own personal website (anywhere on the internet differing from the 
                          original living page of the program) you MUST make reference back to the original 
                          author and cannot make claim that you are the owner/creator of the program. You 
                          also must also note if you have modified the redistributed code.

                                                         6. Forked Programs

                           The Vincent General License allows forking of programs ONLY IF the fork of the 
                           program is placed under the same license.
                           
                               a) If You update a program that was previously under another license/no license 
                               and the version forked includes the old license, then it becomes the responsibility 
                               of You to release a new version of said program that is compliant with this License.
