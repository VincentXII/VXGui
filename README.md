Welcome to VXGUI
================

VXGui is a fork of the experimental Python GUI Framework PyGUI.

Three implementations are provided in this version: 

* MacOSX - requires PyObjC
* Linux - requires pygtk
* Windows - requires pywin32 and ctypes

This package is still under development. The basic set of widgets is
more or less complete, and will probably be expanded in the future.

To install VXGui, open a command line window and do "python setup.py install" install the VXGui folder.

To get started with it, have a look at the documentation starting with
Doc/index.html, and the example applications in the Demos directory.
You may also find it instructive to study the programs in the Tests
directory, although some of them are not written in the best style.
